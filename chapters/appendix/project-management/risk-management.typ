==== Introduction
#p(

    In the section, the strategies employed for managing risks in this project are explored. The risk management involved the identification, analysis, and mitigation of possible risks.

=== Risk Analysis

==== Introduction
#p(
  [
    In the risk analysis process, each identified risk is assigned a probability of occurrence and an impact level should it occur. These values are then used to calculate a risk score, which helps in classifying the risk as low, medium, or high according to the risk matrix. This classification is done twice: firstly, to determine the inherent risk level, which is the risk level before any countermeasures are implemented, and secondly, to assess the residual risk level, which is the risk level after the implementation of countermeasures.

    The risk level formula is used to calculate the the risk score used for the classification of the risk.

==== Inherent Risks Matrix
#p(
  [
    The inherent risks matrix provides a visual representation of the potential risks identified, before any mitigating actions are taken. This matrix categorizes risks based on their likelihood of occurrence and the impact they could have if they materialize.

    _@risk-inherent-matrix _ presents a screenshot from _Jira_ of the inherent risks matrix, showcasing how each risk is categorized and assessed.

==== Residual Risks Matrix

    The residual risks matrix provides a visual representation of the potential risks identified, after the implementation of countermeasures. This matrix categorizes risks based on their likelihood of occurrence and the impact they could have if they materialize.

==== Results
#p(
  [
    #todo[risk result]
    In the risk analysis, six distinct risks were identified. Of these, one was classified as high-risk, one as moderate-risk, and the remaining three as low-risk. Following the implementation of countermeasures, there was a notable reduction in the overall risk levels. While the probability of these risks occurring remained unchanged, the impact of their occurrence was successfully mitigated.
